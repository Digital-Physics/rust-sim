This is my first Rust repositor. It has 'particle affinity model' code that was ported over from python/js.

Some Rust commands:
- `cargo new <project_name>` - Creates a new Rust project with directory structure and Cargo.toml (like package.json in JS or requirements.txt in Python)
- `cargo build` - Compiles your project and creates an executable in target/debug/
- `cargo run` - Compiles and runs your project in one command
- `cargo clean` - Removes build artifacts from the target/ directory

Note: No virtual environment management needed (Rust handles dependencies differently than Python)
